I am an AI Graphics Researcher and PhD Candidate at IMPA ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. My research interest lies in the intersection of computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. My PhD research focuses on neural implicit representations for media objects such as images, videos, and 3D models. In 2022, I was a Research Scientist Intern at Reality Labs Research (Meta) in Pittsburgh, PA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I contributed to the Codec Avatars project, working with inverse rendering, 3D modeling and generative models.

I am also the co-creator of the YouTube channel [ProgramaÃ§Ã£o DinÃ¢mica](http://youtube.com/@pgdinamica), where I talk about programming, data science, artificial intelligence, and scientific outreach, along with my personal experiences and career as a researcher. The channel has garnered over 200K subscribers, was part of the [YouTube Black Voices Fund class of 2022](https://blog.youtube/intl/pt-br/news-and-events/brasil-fundo-vozes-negras-2022/), and was recognized by YouTube as a [Creator of Impact](https://blog.youtube/intl/pt-br/news-and-events/criadores-de-impacto-ampliando-horizontes-e-fortalecendo-a-comunidade/) in 2024.

I have extensive experience in software development, teaching programming across all levels â€” from completely beginners to graduate students â€” and creating educational content in both text and video formats. I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics with a focus on Computer Graphics from IMPA, where my thesis explored implicit surface reconstruction from depth image data. Additionally, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Instituto Militar de Engenharia (Military Institute of Engineering).
